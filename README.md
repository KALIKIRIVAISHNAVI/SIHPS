## Name:KALIKIRI VAISHNAVI
## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
Reward System for Recycling
Gamified Experience: Introduce a gamified system where users earn badges and rewards for recycling different types of e-waste.
Partnerships with Retailers: Collaborate with electronics retailers to offer discounts or gift cards in exchange for credit points earned through recycling.
## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The reward system for the e-waste recycling platform can be designed using a combination of modern web technologies, cloud services, and robust database management to ensure scalability, security, and user engagement. Below is a proposed architecture:

1. Frontend
Web Application: Built using React.js or Angular for a responsive and interactive user interface.
Mobile Application: Developed with React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility on iOS and Android devices.
User Interface Components: For displaying maps, search filters, educational content, user profiles, and reward points.
2. Backend
API Gateway: Amazon API Gateway or Azure API Management to handle API requests securely and efficiently.
Microservices Architecture:
User Service: Manages user authentication, profiles, and account details.
Recycling Facility Service: Handles information about recycling facilities, including location, accepted items, and capacity.
Reward Service: Manages the reward points system, including calculation, allocation, and redemption of points.
Notification Service: Sends email, SMS, and push notifications to users about their recycling activities, reward points, and local events.
Educational Content Service: Manages educational materials, pop-ups, quizzes, and multimedia content.
3. Database
User Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user profiles, recycling history, and reward points.
Facility Database: MySQL or MongoDB for storing information about e-waste facilities.
Rewards Database: Redis or DynamoDB for fast access to reward points data and redemption history.
Analytics Database: Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift for storing and analyzing large sets of data related to user engagement, recycling statistics, and environmental impact reports.
4. Cloud Services
Hosting: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting the web and mobile applications.
Storage: Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing educational content, user-uploaded data, and backups.
Serverless Functions: AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for executing backend logic without managing servers, ideal for processing reward points and sending notifications.
5. Security and Compliance
Authentication and Authorization: Implement OAuth 2.0 with services like Auth0 or Firebase Authentication for secure user login.
Data Encryption: Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit using TLS and encryption services provided by the cloud platform.
Compliance: Ensure the system complies with regulations like GDPR for data protection and privacy.
6. Integration with Third-Party Services
Geolocation Services: Google Maps API or Mapbox for mapping and geolocation functionalities.
Retailer Partnerships: APIs for integrating with retailer systems to offer discounts and rewards.
Payment Gateways: Stripe or PayPal for handling transactions related to reward redemptions and donations.
7. Monitoring and Analytics
Monitoring: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system performance and health.
Analytics: Google Analytics and custom dashboards for tracking user engagement, recycling activities, and reward redemption statistics.
8. Workflow

User Registration/Login:
Users register or log in via the web or mobile app.
Authentication service validates user credentials and manages sessions.

Facility Search and Recycling Submission:
Users search for nearby facilities using the map and search filters.
Users submit information about their recycled items through the app.

Reward Calculation and Allocation:
The reward service calculates points based on the type and amount of e-waste recycled.
Points are added to the user's account in the rewards database.

Notification and Redemption:
Users receive notifications about their earned points and available rewards.
Users can redeem points for discounts or other incentives through integrated retailer systems.

Educational Engagement:
Users interact with educational content, quizzes, and multimedia resources.
Educational service tracks user engagement and provides feedback.
By structuring the reward system in this manner, the e-waste recycling platform can efficiently manage user interactions, reward allocations, and educational engagements, ultimately fostering a community of environmentally conscious users.

## Technology Stack
The technology stack for the E-Waste Facility Locator includes a React.js web application and a React Native mobile app, both using Redux for state management. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, leveraging Amazon API Gateway or Azure API Management for APIs. Databases include PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user and facility data, Redis for rewards, and Google BigQuery for analytics. The platform is hosted on AWS or Google Cloud, utilizing S3 or Cloud Storage, and secured with Auth0 or Firebase Authentication. Monitoring and analytics are handled by Prometheus, Grafana, and Google Analytics, with CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

## Dependencies
The technology stack includes React.js with Redux and Axios for the web frontend, and React Native for the mobile app. The backend uses Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL or MongoDB, and Redis, secured by Auth0 or Firebase Authentication, and hosted on AWS or Google Cloud. Monitoring and CI/CD tools include Prometheus, Grafana, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.
